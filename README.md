  Steps

    -Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes.
    -Retrieved the nearest city
    -Performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.
    -Used API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. 
    -Created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

    -Used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences
    -Then used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
    -Show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

From the list of potential travel destinations I chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API and created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
